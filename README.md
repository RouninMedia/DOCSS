# SECSS (Sequentially Expressed CSS)
SECSS (Sequentially Expressed CSS) is an approach to writing CSS files which builds on the DRY CSS approach.

The two primary defining characteristics of SECSS is that

i) the stylesheet is broken down into subsections, such that the entire document resembles a collection of subsidiary stylesheets; and

ii) the style author groups elements and classes by style declaration, rather than grouping style declarations by element or class.
