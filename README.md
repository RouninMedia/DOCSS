# SECSS (Sequentially Expressed CSS)
SECSS (Sequentially Expressed CSS) is an approach to writing CSS files which builds on the DRY CSS approach.

The two primary defining characteristics of SECSS are that

i) the stylesheet is broken down into sub-sections, such that the entire document resembles a collection of smaller self-contained stylesheets; and

ii) the style author groups elements and classes by style declaration, rather than grouping style declarations by element or class.
