# DOCSS (Declaration Ordered CSS)
DOCSS (Declaration Ordered CSS) is an approach to writing CSS files which builds on the DRY CSS approach.

The **two** primary defining characteristics of DOCSS are that:

1. the style author groups elements and classes by style declaration, rather than grouping style declarations by element or class; and

2. the stylesheet is broken down into sub-sections, such that the entire document *resembles* a collection of smaller, self-contained stylesheets.

The **three** principle advantages of DOCSS are:

1. This approach to stylesheet formatting easily enables the stylesheet author to consistently maintain and update "house style" colours and dimensions across any number of elements - especially when used in conjunction with **CSS Custom Variables**;

2. debugging the stylesheet becomes remarkably straightforward; and

3. refactoring the stylesheet as it evolves and grows becomes very straightforward.

##Before starting DOCSS##

A couple of considerations before you adopt the DOCSS approach to stylesheet formatting. 

###Concise Stylesheets: Three Best Practices###

**1) Where possible, use *CSS shorthands***

*eg.*

Instead of:

``` css
h1 {
border-width: 2px;
border-style: solid;
border-color: rgb(191,191,191);
}
```

use:

``` css
h1 {border: 2px solid rgb(191,191,191);}
```

Instead of:

``` css
h1 {
background-color: rgb(127,0,0);
background-image: url('/assets/theme/elements/heading-logo.png');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: right top;
}
```

use:

``` css
h1 {background: rgb(127,0,0) url('/assets/theme/elements/heading-logo.png') no-repeat right top;}
```


**2) *Similarly*, where possible, group *related* CSS style declarations which consistently appear together**

Instead of:

``` css
h1 {
margin: 6px auto;
}

h1 {
padding: 0 6px;
}

h1 {
font-size: 24px;
}

h1 {
line-height: 36px;
}
```

use:

``` css
.MARGIN-PADDING,
h1 {margin:6px auto; padding:0 6px;}

.TEXT-SIZE,
h1 {font-size:24px; line-height:36px;}
```

**3) *Then*, where possible, group *related* CSS elements and classes which consistently share the same style declarations**

Instead of:

``` css
h1 {color: rgb(127,127,127); font-size: 24px; line-height: 36px;}
h2 {color: rgb(127,127,127); font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;}
h3 {color: rgb(191,191,191); font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;}
```

use:

``` css
.TEXT-COLOR,
h1, h2 {color: rgb(127,127,127);}
h3 {color: rgb(191,191,191);}

.TEXT-SIZE,
h1 {font-size: 24px; line-height: 36px;}
h2, h3 {font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;}

```

###Keeping Stylesheets Maintainable & Legible: An Important Consideration while Following the 3 Concise Stylesheet Best Practices Above###

The objective of having DOCSS on your website is not just to keep your styles relatively concise, but also clearly legible and highly maintainable. Concision is important, but it's not intended to be a consideration which overrides all others .

Reviewing the last example above, it would be *even more* concise to write:

``` css
h1,h2{color:#888;font-size:24px;line-height:36px;}
h2,h3{font-size:18px;line-height:27px;}
h3{color:#bbb;}
```
but, there are arguably 2 problems with this - the first relating to *stylesheet legibility* and the second relating to *stylesheet maintainability*:

1. The stylesheet fragment above declares the `font-size` and the `line-height` of `h2` twice, which requires the human reader to perform the `cascade` in their own head;
2. Now that `h2` appears twice, there is no way to predict where current `h2` style declarations will appear and where future `h2` style declarations *should* appear. This makes the the stylesheet fragment harder to maintain. In DOCSS, splitting styles into semi-autonomous "Declaration Groups", where each element appears ***once only*** enables stylesheets to evolve and be maintained in a consistent and predictable manner;

**In Summary:** A concise stylesheet is the objective. But not at the cost of *legibility* or *maintainability*.
